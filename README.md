# Xray-Fluorescence-Simulation
Simulates x-ray fluorescence for two capillary tubes containing Yttrium-based nanoparticles in a gel phantom.

The x-ray source is pencil beam with monoenergetic photons of 17.4 keV. X-ray fluorescence is detected with an x-ray CCD using a slit apeture. The slit is orientated perpendicular to pencil beam. The simulation produces the fluorescence image with simulated detector noise.
